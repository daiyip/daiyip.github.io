# About
I like beautiful code, not only in how we express ideas, but also in the underlying structures that reveal the law of nature. 

I have been working in Microsoft for 10 years as a Principal Software Engineer Manager, I founded and co-authored project [Napa.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/napajs) and [Winery.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/wineryjs).
