# About
I like beautiful code, not only in how it expresses ideas, but also in its underlying structures that reveal the law of nature. 

I am now working in Google as a software engineer on machine learning, before that I worked in Microsoft as an engineer and an engineer manager. I founded and co-authored project [Napa.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/napajs) and [Winery.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/wineryjs).
